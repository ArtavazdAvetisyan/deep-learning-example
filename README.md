# Simple Deep Learning Example

It's my first experience with deep learning. I have followed the explanation in given link.

My neural network takes 3-bit binary input trainings and it outputs decimal representation of input.
I have 1 input layer with 3 neurons, 1 hidden layer with 5 neurons and, 1 output layer with 8 neurons.

I made this implementation for beginners. I am also a beginner. I wanted to share what I know.
